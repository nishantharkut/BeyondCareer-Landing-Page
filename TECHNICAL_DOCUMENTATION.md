# Technical Documentation

## Technology Stack

**Frontend Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript for type safety and modern development patterns.
**Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first rapid development and consistent design systems.
**Build Tool**: Vite for lightning-fast development and optimized production builds.

## Architecture Decisions

Component-based architecture with reusable UI elements from shadcn/ui library. Custom hooks manage complex state logic, while Context API handles theme management efficiently across the application.

## Performance Optimizations

Lazy loading for images, code splitting for reduced bundle sizes, and CSS optimization through Tailwind's purge functionality. PWA implementation with service workers enables offline functionality.

## Challenges and Solutions

**Challenge**: Complex parallax animations causing performance issues on mobile devices.
**Solution**: Implemented CSS transforms with GPU acceleration and reduced motion preferences for accessibility compliance and smooth performance.
